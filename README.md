# PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I wanted to learn how webpages work, including the different elements, languages, and functions involved with creating content
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I built this project because I am ready to dive in to learning web development for real and begin my journey towards being able to create my own self-guided websites in the future
- What problem does it solve? This project served as an introductory overview of HTML, CSS, Javascript and how they work together to form the content on a webpage, and solved the problem of providing a webpage for me to track my learning progress during the prework
- What did you learn? I learned how to use the command line interface to interact via git/github in order to iterate upon project changes and perform debugging in a manageable way

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to create notes on the various topics learned: HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript, in order to keep track of definitions, tags, and example functions that can be used going forward when creating new webpages. It not only serves as a note-taking source, but also a place where actual code can be written, executed, tested, and debugged to help the learning process.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
